'''
Ray-Tracing method for determinimg if a point is within a polygon.
x - longitudinal coordinate
y - lateral coordinate
polygon - the lon/lat coordinates of the exterior of the polygon

The basic method is to loop through the edges and to determine if the point
is directly to the left of the edge. If the point is directlt to the left
of exactly one edge then it is within the polygon, if it is directly to the
left of 2 edges then it is not within the polygon.

This function is compiled using Numba jit no-Python so it cannot be vectorized
